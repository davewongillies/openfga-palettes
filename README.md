## Instructions

1. Drop the contents of the archives into the root of your MicroSD

1. Enable Screen filters by booting all DMG games in GBC mode via Settings -> Pocket -> Systems -> GB -> Hardware -> Force GBC Mode

Important warning: There is currently flashing as the LCD off color doesn't work
correctly, if you're sensitive to strobing effects don't use the inverted profiles.
On regular profiles it should not be visible

Many thanks to @flamepanther for the SGB Vaporwave palettes and Al\_Levin on Reddit
for the Unique Games and Unusued BIOS palettes.
(Also included are a few fixed base palettes that didn't have the LCD\_Off set correctly)
